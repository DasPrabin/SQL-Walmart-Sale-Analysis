Revenue And Profit Calculations
$ COGS = unitsPrice * quantity $

$ VAT = 5% * COGS $

VAT is added to the 
COGS
 and this is what is billed to the customer.

$ total(gross_sales) = VAT + COGS $

$ grossProfit(grossIncome) = total(gross_sales) - COGS $

Gross Margin is gross profit expressed in percentage of the total(gross profit/revenue)

$ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}} $

Example with the first row in our DB:

Data given:

$ \text{Unite Price} = 45.79 $
$ \text{Quantity} = 7 $
$ COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53 $

$ \text{VAT} = 5% * COGS\= 5% 320.53 = 16.0265 $

$ total = VAT + COGS\= 16.0265 + 320.53 = 
336.5565

$ \text{Gross Margin Percentage} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}}\=\frac{16.0265}{336.5565} = 0.047619\\approx 4.7619% $
